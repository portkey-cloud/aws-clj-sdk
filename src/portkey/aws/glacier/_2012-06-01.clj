The multipart upload ID is\nused in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see\nUploadMultipartPart).\n When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of\nbytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for\nexample, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so\non. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.\n Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except the\nlast one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller.\nFor example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the\nmultipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB\neach and one part of 0.2 MB.\n You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart\nupload because Amazon Glacier does not require you to specify the overall\narchive size.\n After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the multipart\nupload resource referenced by the ID. Amazon Glacier also removes the multipart\nupload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there\nis no activity for a period of 24 hours.\n An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).\nHowever, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any\npermissions by default.

(clojure.core/defn list-jobs "This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are in-progress and\njobs that have recently finished. The List Job operation returns a list of these\njobs sorted by job initiation time.\n Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting\nthem; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed\njobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they\nhave completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job\ncompletion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example,\nsuppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job\ncompletes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In\nthis scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.\n The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the\nresponse Marker field. If there are no more jobs to list, the Marker field is\nset to null. If there are more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to a\nnon-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To\nreturn a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request\nparameter to the Marker value for that job that you obtained from a previous\nList Jobs request.\n You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by\nspecifying the limit parameter in the request. The default limit is 1000. The\nnumber of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of\nreturned jobs never exceeds the limit.\n Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional\nstatuscode parameter or completed parameter, or both. Using the statuscode\nparameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the InProgress,\nSucceeded, or Failed status. Using the completed parameter, you can specify to\nreturn only jobs that were completed (true) or jobs that were not completed\n(false).\n For more information about using this operation, see the documentation for the\nunderlying REST API List Jobs\n(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-jobs-get.html)."
